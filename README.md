#  Currently Under Development
## rubik-s-cube-solver


This is a C++ based project completely made from scratch, (uses C++ STL).
I seek to advance this to future uses later on in future.

## About this project - 
1. The file [`structures.cpp`](./structures.cpp) contains the classes required to simulate a cube.
2. The file [`algo.cpp`](./algo.cpp) contains the actual implementation of A* Algorithm  with the objects to solve the cube.
3. the main.cpp is the file which makes use of the things declared in algo.cpp and structures.cpp and combines them with input and output.

-- Uses basic cube notations like F, F', U, U', D, D', B, B', L, L', R, R'
